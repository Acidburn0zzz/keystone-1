Keystone Applications
=====================

What is the Keystone SDK

Important Disclaimer
---------------------------

The current version (0.X) of Keystone is not formally verified, nor matured, which means that it might have bugs or unknown security holes.
We recommend you to use Keystone only for research purposes until it gets stablized.
We appreciate any contribution for making Keystone better.

Since no hardware has been built for Keystone, we provide a few ways to deploy and test Keystone for building secure systems and developing enclave applications.
